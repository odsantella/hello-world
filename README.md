Hello everybody,

My name's Odie and I have zero knowledge into this new world but it is exciting to know that I could potentially help more people doing this than my previous career path, which is Occupational Therapy. 
I looked into different careers that are related to my hobby and passions and have not found my career.
The possibilities into coding could still connect me through those passions, although indirectly, it would still keep my interests flowing throughout the years, at least, hopefully.
